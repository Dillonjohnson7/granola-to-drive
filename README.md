# granola-to-drive

Auto-sync your [Granola](https://granola.ai) meeting notes — including **full transcripts** — to a Google Drive folder so you can search them, share them, or hand them to an AI assistant.

Runs autonomously every hour on your Mac. No paid Granola plan required.

## What you get

For every meeting, a plain-text dossier in your Drive folder:

```
Khanh Dang
Date: Apr 22, 2026 7:46 PM
Granola Meeting ID: b6b44320-8e21-4870-8db8-dcc02585aab4
Tags: investor-pitch | aerospace-defense, fundraising, humanoids
Participants: Dillon Johnson <…>, Khanh Dang <…>

================================================================
AI SUMMARY
================================================================
…the structured AI summary panel from Granola…

================================================================
PRIVATE NOTES
================================================================
…your own typed notes during the meeting…

================================================================
FULL TRANSCRIPT
================================================================
[00:00:03] Host: …
[00:00:11] You: …
…
```

Filenames are `<title>, YYYY-MMM-DD.txt` — readable in Finder and Drive.

## How it works

Three scripts run in sequence, kicked off by a macOS LaunchAgent every hour:

1. **`fetch_granola.py`** reads the WorkOS access token Granola's desktop app stores at `~/Library/Application Support/Granola/supabase.json`, then calls Granola's internal API to pull every meeting's metadata, AI summary panels, and full transcript. Saves to `~/Library/Application Support/Granola/granola_export/`.
2. **`build_docs.py`** turns the raw JSON into one plain-text dossier per meeting.
3. **`tag_meetings.py`** (optional) injects a `Tags:` line into each dossier using simple keyword rules — `customer-discovery`, `investor-pitch`, etc. Edit the rules to match your own buckets.
4. **`rclone copy`** uploads only new/changed dossiers to a folder in your Drive.

The official Granola MCP gates transcripts behind a paid plan. The desktop app already has them cached locally with a valid auth token — we just reuse it. Read-only, never writes back to Granola.

## Setup (3 minutes)

### Prerequisites
- macOS with Granola desktop app installed and signed in
- Homebrew
- Python 3.10+

### One-command install
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<you>/granola-to-drive.git ~/granola-to-drive
cd ~/granola-to-drive
./install.sh
```

The installer will:
1. `brew install rclone`
2. Run `rclone config` to authenticate with your Google account (one-time browser OAuth)
3. Copy the scripts into `~/Library/Application Support/Granola/claude_sync/`
4. Install the LaunchAgent at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.cowork.granola-fetch.plist`
5. Kick off a manual test run to backfill all your meetings

By default the LaunchAgent fires every hour from 7am–9pm. Edit the plist if you want a different schedule.

### Configuration

Set these env vars in `~/.granola-to-drive.env` (or just edit `refresh.sh` directly):

```bash
# Drive folder name (will be created if missing). Default: "Knowledge Based"
export GRANOLA_DRIVE_FOLDER="Knowledge Based"

# rclone remote name (created during `rclone config`). Default: "gdrive"
export GRANOLA_RCLONE_REMOTE="gdrive"
```

## Using the synced data

### Search in Drive
- Filter by tag: search `Tags: customer-discovery` or `aerospace-defense`
- Find a person: search the participant's email or name
- Find a topic: full-text search picks up summary + private notes + full transcript

### Ask Claude / ChatGPT / etc.
With Drive connected to Cowork (or any LLM that can read Drive), ask things like:
> *"Summarize what Roger Misiaszek said about explosives manufacturing automation requirements."*
> *"Find every meeting where someone mentioned clean rooms."*
> *"What were the top three customer pain points in my mentor-advisor sessions about fundraising?"*

The model just reads the dossier files.

## Customizing the tags

Edit `tag_meetings.py`:

- **`TITLE_RULES`** — regex matchers against meeting titles. First match wins.
- **`OVERRIDES`** — keyed by Granola meeting UUID. Use this for one-off corrections after reviewing the auto-tags.
- **`INDUSTRY_KEYWORDS`** / **`TOPIC_KEYWORDS`** — body keyword matchers that add secondary tags.

After editing, just run:
```bash
python3 ~/Library/Application\ Support/Granola/claude_sync/tag_meetings.py
```
…and the next hourly sync will push the updates to Drive.

## Troubleshooting

**"Token expired" in the log**
The WorkOS access token lasts ~6 hours and refreshes whenever you open the Granola desktop app. If you go a full day without opening it, that hour's run no-ops cleanly — just open the app once and the next run picks up.

**Nothing showing up in Drive**
Check `~/Library/Logs/granola-fetch.log` for errors. The script logs every step.

**Granola changes their API**
This uses an undocumented internal API. If Granola changes endpoints or request shape, fix `fetch_granola.py`. Reverse-engineering references in [`docs/api-notes.md`](docs/api-notes.md).

## Caveats

- **Unofficial** — uses Granola's internal API. Could break with any Granola update.
- **Read-only on Granola** — never writes back, but exfiltrating your own data is a gray area. Personal use only.
- **Your local `supabase.json` token can read all your Granola data.** Treat the file like a password.
- **Single-user** — designed for one Mac, one Drive account. Multi-user not supported.
